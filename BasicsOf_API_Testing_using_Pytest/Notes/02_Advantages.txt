 1. Testing APIs will give you more test coverage than UI Testing.

 2. Earlier Testing.
    - We can test way before UI is ready.
    - Reduces the UI testing time.
    - Agile Scrum methodology.

3. Sample application but on different platforms use same APIs (No need to rework).
    - Web UI
    - Mobile UI
    - Desktop UI

4. Faster time to resolution.
    - Directly report the defect regarding API end point instead of UI.

5. Easier Test maintenance.
    - APIs won't change like UI.

6. Faster Testing.
    - API Testing takes less time.
    - No need to load any UI.
    - API takes minutes while UI takes hours.

7. Bypassing the UI Layers validations or restrictions.
