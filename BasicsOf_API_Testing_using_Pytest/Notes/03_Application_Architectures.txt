There are two architectures of Application and that are :
1. Monolithic :
2. Microservice :


1. Monolithic :


        Application
             |
             |
     Complete App code
         Services


    - Every feature is part of single code base
    - Changes in one frame may produce side effects in other features
    - Takes alot of time to do code changes as all the code of different features is together
    - We are disturbing the existing features due to code changes
    - Quick deployment is not possible due to above reasons.


2. Microservice :

               Application

    - What is a Microservice ?
        - Breaks the large software applications into loosly coupled modules, which communicate
          over API
    - Micro-services architecture break down into a collection of smaller independent units
      having separate logic, process, service and database.
    - Communication between these independent units will happen over APIs
    - Advantages :
        1. Easy maintenance
        2. Quick deployment
        3. Not impacting other features
